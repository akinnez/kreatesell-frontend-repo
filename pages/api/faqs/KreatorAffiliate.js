        question: "What is the minimum withdrawal amount?", 
        answer: `The payout for Nigerian Kreators is automatic. But for Kreators outside Nigeria, payouts are made immediately you click the withdraw button. You receive the total balance in your wallet at once. Before you can withdraw, you are required to have a minimum balance as follows:
        <br/><br/>
        Nigerian Naira (NGN): NGN 50
        Ghana Cedi (GHS): GHS 10
        Kenyan Shilling (KES): KES 100
        Tanzanian Shilling (TZS): TZS 3500
        Ugandan Shilling (UGX): UGX 12, 000
        South African Rands (ZAR): ZAR 12
        Central African CFA franc (XAF): 600 XAF
        West African CFA franc (XOF): 600 XOF
        US Dollars (USD): USD 0 - Free (via PayPal)
        British Pounds (GBP): GBP 0 - Free (via PayPal)
        This serves as the withdrawal fees for taking funds out of your wallet.
        <br/><br/>
        However, as an affiliate, you have to make successful sales and accumulate commissions to a threshold amount of N5,000 or $20 for you to get your first payment. Payouts are made every Tuesday.
