        answer: `To be eligible for a refund, the product must primarily have a refund policy attached. You can either request from the Kreator directly or escalate to Kreatesell for follow up. 

        After you have reached out to the Kreator for a refund, you can escalate your request by simply sending an email with details of your refund request to payment@kreatesell.com. Please include the words “Refund Request” in the subject line of your email to help us get to it quickly. 
        
        Your refund request must be made within 30 days of purchase. Refunds would be made within 30 days from the requested date if the product is eligible. Kindly note that you might not receive your full purchase fee as transaction fees removed for purchasing the product cannot be retrieved.

        question: "How does the bank transfer payment option work?", 
        answer: `If you are buying from Nigeria, you have the option to pay using a bank transfer method. Unlike the normal bank transfer where you transfer funds to a registered bank account, this transfer method makes use of an automation process in which a temporary unique account number is created automatically to use in paying for the product.
        After payment has been made into the unique account number, the system automatically checks to see if the amount is correct. If the amount is more than the checkout amount for the product, the system sends the change back. If the amount is less than the cost of the product, the system rejects the money and reverses the money back to the buyer’s account. Reversal is usually within 24 hours. If you don’t get the money back after 24 hours, kindly reach out to us at payment@kreatesell.com.`
